## TODO

- Add pause and next with keyboard

## DONE

x Fix crash on algorithm finish
x Make yielded rendering output of a consistent type
  - THREE.Vector3? { x, y, z }? [x, y, z]?
  - Went with [x, y, z] because it was simple and more on the agnostic side
x Get gift-wrapping algorithm working with yields
x Get gift-wrapping algorithm working without the yields
